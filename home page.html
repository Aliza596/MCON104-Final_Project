    <p>Best food around! I was sooo homesick, and the food in my sem was disgusting but this food tasted just like my mother's.</p>

    <p>Best prices!! My brother lives in Ramat Eshkol and he just had a baby, but since I live in America, I couldn't be there to cook for my sister-in-law. I order them this food and they loved it. Best part about it, it didn't break the bank! Thank you!</p>
